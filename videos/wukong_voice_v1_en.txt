This world was never moved by the smartest minds.
It was pulled by weight.

Einstein changed how time is measured,
but oil still decided where power flowed.

Hawking saw the edge of the universe,
yet every morning,
the market still searched for energy.

When voices became louder than reason,
gravity shifted.

No proof was required.
No system was consulted.
Noise itself became mass.

Some waited.
Some ruled by patience.
Some stood in places history had to record.

Knowledge is light.
But weight is gravity.

Those who control gravity
never need to explain.

History remembers inventors.
But direction
is always dragged by mass.

This is not unfair.
This is physics.

When you try to change the world,
ask yourself one thing:

Do you have weight?
