# KLINE Odyssey · Bitcoin Chapter

This directory is part of the KLINE App Game universe.

It is not a trading platform.
It is not an investment product.
It is a narrative and behavioral record of the Bitcoin market.

## What this is

- A structural archive for the Bitcoin chapter
- Raw data, processed data, and derived market behavior

Bitcoin, in this universe, is not a currency.
It is an extreme form of human behavior under stress.

Price is not the focus.
Behavior is.
