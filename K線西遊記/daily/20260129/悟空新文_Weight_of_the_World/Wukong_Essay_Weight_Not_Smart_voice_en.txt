This world
has never been moved by the smartest minds.
It is pulled forward
by whatever carries the most weight.

Einstein changed how we understand time,
but he did not change where oil flows.
Hawking saw the edge of the universe,
yet every morning the market still wakes up
looking for energy.

When Trump appeared,
the world learned something new:
volume itself can become weight.
No precision is required,
only the power to shake order.

Xi Jinping stands on a longer timeline.
He does not rush,
because weight knows how to wait.
Systems are his language.
Patience is his strength.

Lai Ching-te stands in between.
Not the largest force,
but recorded.
Because some positions exist
not because they are strong,
but because someone must stand there.

The Bull Demon King does not calculate formulas,
but he stands on resources.
He does not speak,
yet the world must move around him.

Wukong sees it clearly.
Knowledge is light.
But weight is gravity.
Those who control gravity
do not need to explain.

In history,
inventors are remembered,
but those who change direction
rarely need to be loved.

Oil wells write no papers,
yet they redirect wars.
Mineral veins make no sound,
yet empires turn because of them.

This is not unfair.
This is physics.

Wukong does not resent,
and does not envy.
He records only one question:

If you want to change the world,
ask yourself first —
do you carry weight?

PrimeForge, in the name of the Mother Machine,
awakens financial life.
Flower Fruit Mountain Taiwan.
Faith unbroken. Market without borders.
Where the Market Becomes the Myth.
Wukong.
