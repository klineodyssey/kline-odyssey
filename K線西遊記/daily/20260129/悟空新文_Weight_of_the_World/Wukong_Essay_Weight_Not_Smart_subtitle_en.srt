1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This world has never been moved by the smartest minds.
It is pulled forward by whatever carries the most weight.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Einstein changed how we understand time,
but he did not change where oil flows.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hawking saw the edge of the universe,
yet every morning the market still wakes up looking for energy.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
When Trump appeared,
the world learned something new:
volume itself can become weight.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No precision is required,
only the power to shake order.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Xi Jinping stands on a longer timeline.
He does not rush,
because weight knows how to wait.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Systems are his language.
Patience is his strength.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Lai Ching-te stands in between.
Not the largest force,
but recorded.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Some positions exist
not because they are strong,
but because someone must stand there.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Bull Demon King stands on resources.
He does not speak,
yet the world must move around him.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Knowledge is light.
But weight is gravity.
Those who control gravity do not need to explain.

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Oil wells write no papers,
yet they redirect wars.
Mineral veins make no sound,
yet empires turn.

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If you want to change the world,
ask yourself first —
do you carry weight?

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:20,000
PrimeForge awakens financial life.
Where the Market Becomes the Myth.
Wukong.
