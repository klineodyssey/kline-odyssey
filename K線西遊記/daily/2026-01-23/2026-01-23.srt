1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is not about whether something will go up or not.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It has never been about buying or selling.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It is about whether you chose to stand in the right position early enough.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Most people enter the market asking one question.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Will this go up?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But those who stay long enough ask a different one.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Will this system continue to exist?

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
KGEN does not exist to replace fiat money.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It is not designed to change how merchants receive payments.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Customers still pay with cash, credit cards, or digital wallets.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Merchants still issue invoices and handle accounting as usual.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What changes happens behind the scenes.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
KGEN functions as a reward and settlement layer.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Every transaction generates real system flow.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Zero point three percent system fee is applied.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This is not speculation. This is structural cash flow.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The system will continue to run.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The only difference is whether you are inside it.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
