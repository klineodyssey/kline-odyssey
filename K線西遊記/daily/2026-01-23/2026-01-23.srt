00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is not about asking merchants to accept crypto.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It is about helping you keep more customers,
at a lower cost.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
KGEN is not designed to replace New Taiwan Dollars.
It exists as a reward and settlement layer.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Customers pay as usual.
Merchants operate as usual.
The system handles rewards in the background.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For merchants, nothing changes.
For customers, rewards become usable and transferable.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Traditional card fees are two to three percent.
KGEN’s system fee is only zero point three percent.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:16,000
KGEN is not a token for speculation.
It is embedded in system operations.

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Data, games, transactions, and IP
all route through KGEN.

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Every transaction produces system flow.
Burn, liquidity, banking, and rewards.

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Five hundred seats.
Five thousand KGEN locked.
Unlock means exit.

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is not about whether KGEN goes up.
It is about whether you are inside.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:40,000
