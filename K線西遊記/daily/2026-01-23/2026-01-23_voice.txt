This video is not market analysis.
It is not investment advice.
And it is not telling you to buy any token.

This is an explanation of a system.

KGEN is not designed to replace fiat currency.
Merchants do not need to change their payment flow.
Customers still pay with cash, credit cards, or LINE Pay.
Invoices stay the same.
Accounting stays the same.

The system works in the background.

KGEN functions as a reward and settlement layer.

For merchants, nothing changes.
For customers, rewards become something that can be used,
transferred,
and upgraded inside the system.

Why would merchants consider this?

Traditional card fees range from two to three percent.
KGEN on-chain transaction tax is only zero point three percent.

As the system evolves,
KGEN can be used to offset fees,
as a marketing reward,
and as a mechanism to retain returning customers.

Merchants using KGEN
can be listed on the Flower Fruit Mountain and Mars merchant map,
gain exposure through the KLINE App and community,
and become certified ecosystem nodes.

What we will not do is very clear.
We do not require KGEN for invoicing.
We do not touch existing cash flow.
And we do not ask merchants to take token price risk.

KGEN exists because it occupies a position
that cannot be removed from the system.

As long as the system operates,
KGEN is used.

Data processing consumes KGEN.
Game evolution consumes KGEN.
Transactions return KGEN.
Content and IP revenue can flow back into KGEN.

This is not an option.
It is structural.

Every transaction generates a zero point three percent system tax.
Zero point one percent is permanently burned.
Zero point one percent flows into the system bank.
Zero point zero five percent supports liquidity.
And zero point zero five percent enters the reward pool.

If the system is used,
cash flow exists.

Only five hundred seats exist on the Five-Finger Mountain.
Entry requires locking five thousand KGEN.
Unlocking means exit.
There are no gifts.
No airdrops.
No guarantees.

This is not a reward.
It is proof that you are willing to bear the time cost of the system.

The real question is not whether KGEN will rise.
The real question is:
If this system runs for ten years,
will you be inside it?
