This is not about asking merchants to accept crypto.

It is about helping you keep more customers,
at a lower cost,
without changing your existing payment flow.

KGEN is not designed to replace New Taiwan Dollars.
It exists as a reward and settlement layer.

Here is how it works in practice.

Customers continue to pay with cash,
credit cards,
or LINE Pay.

Merchants continue issuing invoices
and reporting taxes as usual.

Behind the scenes,
the system converts part of the reward value
into KGEN
and delivers it to customers.

For merchants,
nothing changes.

For customers,
rewards become something usable,
transferable,
and upgradable.

Why would merchants use this system?

Traditional card fees are around two to three percent.

KGEN’s on-chain transaction fee is only zero point three percent.

In the future,
KGEN can be used to offset processing fees,
serve as marketing rewards,
and retain returning customers.

Merchants using KGEN
are listed on the Flower Fruit Mountain and Mars merchant map,
gain exposure through the KLINE App and community,
and become officially recognized ecosystem nodes.

What we will not do is equally important.

We do not require KGEN for invoicing.
We do not touch your existing cash flow.
And we do not ask merchants to bear token price risk.

In one sentence:

You continue running your business as usual.
We help you keep customers
at a lower cost.

Now, why is KGEN worth serious attention?

KGEN does not exist because it might go up in price.

It exists because it occupies a position
that cannot be replaced.

Its value does not come from imagination.

It comes from being embedded
in a system that continuously generates behavior,
transactions,
and content.

As long as the system operates:

Data processing uses KGEN.
Game evolution consumes KGEN.
Transactions generate KGEN flow.
IP monetization can route back into KGEN.

KGEN is not an option.
It is part of the structure.

Every transaction produces a zero point three percent system fee.

Zero point one percent is burned permanently.
Zero point one percent goes into the system bank.
Zero point zero five percent supports liquidity.
Zero point zero five percent flows into the reward pool.

As long as people use the system,
cash flow appears.

There is also a threshold for those who stay.

Five hundred seats only.
Locking five thousand KGEN.
Unlocking means exit.
No giveaways.
No airdrops.
No guarantees.

This is not a reward.

It is proof of whether
you are willing to bear the cost of time.

So the real question is not:
Will KGEN go up?

The real question is:
If this system runs for ten years,
will you be inside it?
