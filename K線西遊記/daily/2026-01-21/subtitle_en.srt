1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Some things were never about whether you buy or not.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
They were always about one question:
did you step into the right position early enough?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Most people enter the market asking only one thing:
will this go up?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But those who can walk for a long time
ask a different question.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Will this system continue to exist?

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
TAIEX futures have been here for more than twenty years.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The market did not disappear.
It simply kept replacing the people who stayed.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Those who remain are not the luckiest.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
They are the ones who stand inside a structure.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
From the very beginning,
KGEN was never designed to please everyone.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It does not promise profit.
It does not guarantee outcomes.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And it does not predict the future.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It does only one thing:
it records those who can stay.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Data is produced every day.
Computation runs every day.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Code endures time every day.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The system will keep moving forward,
whether you are here or not.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Are you a spectator,
or are you part of the structure?

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
火星五指山，只留五百個席位。

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
條件寫得很清楚：
持有並鎖定 5000 KGEN。

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
PrimeForge 以母機之名，開啟金融生命。

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
花果山台灣・信念不滅・市場無界。

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Where the Market Becomes the Myth.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
