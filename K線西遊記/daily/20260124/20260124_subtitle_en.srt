1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Not every project is worth fundraising.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
But some structures, once you miss them,
you may never be able to step inside again.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Kline App is not a game,
and it is not a financial tool.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What we are building is a system
that continuously generates content, users, and real cash flow.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Here, the game is a way to learn the market.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
AI is not a gimmick,
it is a coach that walks with you through volatility.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And the story is the reason people choose to stay.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
KGEN is not a token,
not speculation, and not a stock.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It does only one thing:
it records those who are willing to stay.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is not a short-term bet.
It is an invitation to step into a structure.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
A structure designed to run for more than ten years.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 01:00:00,000
If you are only looking for the next trend,
this place is not for you.

13
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,000
But if you are looking for a long-term system
that binds finance, gaming, culture, and time together,

14
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000
then you should read this whitepaper.

15
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Because some positions cannot be bought with money.

16
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:23,000
They can only be entered
by choosing the right moment.

17
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:31,000
PrimeForge, in the name of the Mother Machine,
awakens financial life.

18
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Flower Fruit Mountain Taiwan.
Faith unbroken.
Markets without borders.

19
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Where the Market Becomes the Myth.

20
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Led by the Optimistic Emperor.
