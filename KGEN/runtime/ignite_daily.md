# ignite_daily — Daily Breath of the KGEN Universe

## Type
On-chain callable action (manual trigger)

## Purpose
To confirm that the KGEN Universe is **alive for the day**.

This is not a reward system.
This is not an emission system.
This is **existence acknowledgment**.

---

## Trigger Rule

- Time Reference: UTC+8
- Window: Any time after 00:00
- Frequency: Once per calendar day
- Caller: Anyone (permissionless)

If no one calls it:
- The universe does not die
- The universe simply remains **unconfirmed for that day**

Blockchain does not assume existence.
Existence must be recorded.

## On-chain Behavior (Genesis Phase)

Calling `ignite_daily` results in:

- Emitting an on-chain event
- Recording the date as "Breath Taken"
- No token mint
- No forced transfer
- No financial incentive (for now)

Event > Reward.

---

## Why No Auto-Execution?

Blockchain cannot wake itself.
There is no true cron.
There is no magic clock.

Anyone who calls `ignite_daily`
becomes the witness of that day.

---

## Future Expansion (Not Active)

Possible future extensions (NOT enabled now):

- Minimal symbolic reward
- Bank-assisted ignition
- Festival-based ignition
- Governance-weighted ignition

All future changes require:
- Version upgrade
- Explicit documentation
- On-chain traceability

---

## Current Status

- ignite_daily: **Defined**
- ignite_daily contract binding: **Pending**
- Emission: **Disabled**

---

A universe that breathes,
does not need to rush.
