# ignite_hourly — Hourly Heartbeat (Reserved)

## Status
Reserved / Not Activated

---

## Concept

`ignite_hourly` represents the **heartbeat** of the universe,
distinct from the daily breath.

- Daily Breath = existence confirmation
- Hourly Heartbeat = activity intensity

Heartbeat without purpose
is noise.

---

## Why It Is Not Active

At Genesis stage:

- No large user base
- No automated agents
- No need for high-frequency signals

Activating hourly heartbeat too early
creates meaningless data.

---

## Future Conditions for Activation

ignite_hourly may be activated when:

- KGEN is used by multiple independent actors
- On-chain actions exceed daily rhythm
- System health monitoring is required
- Governance explicitly enables it

Until then:
This file exists as a **design placeholder** only.

---

## Reminder

Not everything that can be done,
should be done early.
