# ignite_hourly — Hourly Heartbeat of the KGEN Universe

## Status
Reserved / Not Activated

---

## Definition

`ignite_hourly` represents the **heartbeat** of the KGEN Universe.

- **Daily Breath (`ignite_daily`)**  
  → Confirms existence  
- **Hourly Heartbeat (`ignite_hourly`)**  
  → Measures activity intensity  

Existence answers **「還活著嗎」**  
Heartbeat answers **「活得多激烈」**

---

## Core Principle

Heartbeat without purpose  
is noise.

At Genesis stage,
the universe must **breathe first**  
before it is allowed to **race**.

---

## Why ignite_hourly Is Not Active

At Genesis stage:

- No sufficiently large participant base
- No autonomous agents requiring sub-daily cadence
- No systemic risk that demands hourly monitoring
- No governance mandate for high-frequency signals

Activating hourly heartbeat too early would:

- Produce meaningless on-chain data
- Increase cognitive noise
- Create false urgency

Silence is sometimes the most accurate signal.

---

## Intended Function (Future)

When activated, `ignite_hourly` may be used to:

- Record universe activity intensity
- Monitor system stress and rhythm
- Support health metrics (CTI / CHR / CBP)
- Assist higher-frequency governance or AI agents

Activation implies:
The universe has entered a **new operational phase**.

---

## Conditions for Activation

`ignite_hourly` may only be activated when **all** of the following are true:

- KGEN is used by multiple independent actors
- On-chain interactions exceed daily rhythm
- System health monitoring is required
- Governance explicitly enables hourly cadence
- Epoch version is upgraded and documented

Until then:
No contract binding.
No emission.
No reward.

---

## Guardian Principle

When activated in the future:

- The caller may be defined as **Hourly Witness**
- Rewards, if any, must be explicitly documented
- No retroactive assumptions are allowed

---

## Final Statement

Not everything that can be done  
should be done early.

A universe that knows when **not** to beat  
will survive longer.
