# KGEN Runtime Layer

This directory defines the **runtime behavior** of the KGEN Universe.

Runtime is not about code first.
Runtime is about **whether the universe is alive**.

A universe that cannot breathe on-chain,
is only a document, not a system.

## What is Runtime?

Runtime defines:

- When the universe is considered "alive"
- How time is acknowledged on-chain
- How events are recorded immutably
- What can be triggered by anyone
- What is NOT automated by fantasy

---

## Current Active Runtime

- Daily Breath: `ignite_daily`
- Hourly Heartbeat: reserved, not activated

No automatic minting.  
No forced emission.  
No inflation illusion.

Only **existence confirmation**.

---

## Design Principles

1. Blockchain does not wake itself up  
2. Time exists only when someone acts  
3. Events > Rewards  
4. Record first, distribute later  
5. Minimal action, maximal meaning

## Status

- Runtime Layer: **Genesis Active**
- Emission Layer: **Disabled**
- Reward Layer: **Not yet enabled**
- Governance Layer: **Reserved**
