1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In the KGEN universe, a token is not a static asset.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It is a financial life form that is still being born.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
KGEN is not defined by features, but by layers of life.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The first layer is called Breath.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Breath is not mining, yield, or an airdrop.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It confirms only one thing: the universe exists today.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Once per day. No efficiency. No optimization.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Before heartbeat, we learn how to breathe.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Heartbeat is defined, but not yet activated.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This is not delay. This is discipline.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Time is recognized, not accelerated.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
First, we breathe. Then we decide when to beat.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Where the Market Becomes the Myth.
