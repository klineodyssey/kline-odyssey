# KAIOS World Viewer V1

## 1. Decision Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Human Decision | `HUMAN-WORLD-VIEWER-001` |
| Architecture | `BASELINE_FROZEN_V1.0` |
| Implementation | `NOT_STARTED` |
| Sandbox Task Envelope | `PREPARED_NOT_CLAIMED` |
| Deployment | `NOT_STARTED` |
| Executable `index.html` | `NOT_CREATED` |
| Art / 3D / animation | `OUT_OF_SCOPE` |

This package defines the first KAIOS map control surface for land. It does not create a working map, modify a registry, grant land, authenticate a player, request GPS, or deploy a Pages route.

## 2. Architecture Verdict

Create a separate, versionless World Viewer architecture rather than extending the V8.1 card viewer in place.

The future runtime will have one executable entry:

```text
KGEN-KAIOS/world-viewer/index.html
```

The intended permanent public alias is:

```text
/world-viewer/
```

Neither entry is created in this architecture phase. Future JavaScript, CSS, worker and data assets are subordinate resources; they are not alternate application entry points.

## 3. Required Navigation Hierarchy

```text
EARTH / K280
-> REGION
-> CITY
-> LAND_PARCEL
-> BUILDING
-> ROOM
```

The hierarchy is semantic zoom, not six unrelated pages. Drag, zoom and selection remain the primary navigation model.

## 4. Source Audit

| Source | Classification | Finding | World Viewer Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `HUMAN-WORLD-VIEWER-001` | Human Decision | Authorizes UI architecture only | Highest task authority |
| `KGEN-KAIOS/constitution/KAIOS_CONSTITUTION.md` | CURRENT Constitution | Architecture before implementation; Human final authority | Mandatory |
| `docs/physics/KGEN_Universe_Physics_Runtime_CURRENT.md` | Protected CURRENT Runtime | Defines XYZ observation axes, K-Sphere and K-index scale | Read only; never modified here |
| `docs/maps/README.md` | CURRENT map selector | Selects Universe Map V10.2 as current shared coordinate map | Coordinate context only |
| `docs/maps/UniverseMap_V10_2_DISTANCE_COMPLETE_ALL_POINTS.json` | CURRENT shared map | Contains Earth surface point `coord=280` and historical distance data | Not a parcel registry |
| `KGEN-KAIOS/land/LAND_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE_BASELINE.md` | Frozen baseline | Owns K280, Parcel, ownership geometry and rights separation | Viewer imports by reference |
| `KGEN-KAIOS/land/land_runtime_architecture.json` | Approved architecture model | Zero-state, prototype-only, implementation not started | No state mutation |
| `KGEN-KAIOS/V8.1/index.html` | Historical prototype | Read-only cards, tabs and graph relationships | Preserve; do not overwrite |
| `KGEN-KAIOS/V8.1/v81.js` | Historical prototype | No geographic drag, zoom, parcel picking or context actions | Reuse concepts only |
| `KGEN-KAIOS/V8/schemas/land.schema.json` | Historical schema | Generic coordinates and zoning; not sufficient for spherical parcel picking | Compatibility adapter only |
| `KGEN-KAIOS/V8/schemas/building.schema.json` | Historical schema | Building identity exists; no floor/room geometry contract | Gap to resolve before implementation |
| Isolated K280 proposal worktree | Candidate evidence | Defines geodetic position, spherical polygon and Local ENU in greater detail | Informative only; frozen baseline wins on conflict |

## 5. Gap Analysis

The repository has no approved implementation contract for all of the following together:

- Region and City spatial indexes.
- Parcel geometry snapshots consumable by a browser.
- Building footprint and floor geometry.
- Room identity and local geometry.
- Player session to Starter Parcel binding.
- Consent-scoped location lookup.
- Secure command persistence from a static GitHub Pages client.

World Viewer V1 therefore defines adapter boundaries and draft projections. It does not promote those projections into Land Runtime schemas or a new Source of Truth.

## 6. Package Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `WORLD_VIEWER_ARCHITECTURE.md` | System boundary, hierarchy and review decisions |
| `WORLD_VIEWER_RUNTIME.md` | Modules, state machine, loading and command boundaries |
| `CAMERA_STANDARD.md` | Drag, zoom, semantic level and camera transitions |
| `SELECTION_STANDARD.md` | Parcel picking, context menu and intent rules |
| `COORDINATE_MAPPING_STANDARD.md` | K280 geodetic, screen and Local ENU mapping |
| `UI_LAYOUT_STANDARD.md` | Map-first responsive layout and inspector contract |
| `world_viewer_architecture.json` | Machine-readable architecture proposal |
| `WORLD_VIEWER_V1_ARCHITECTURE_RESOLUTION.md` | Resolution of the twelve review amendments |
| `ADR/ADR-WV-001-WEB-FIRST-SYNTHETIC-VIEWER.md` | Web-first 2D and untrusted-client decision record |
| `WORLD_VIEWER_V1_ARCHITECTURE_BASELINE.md` | Frozen V1 architecture baseline |
| `world_viewer_v1_architecture_baseline.json` | Baseline manifest and SHA-256 evidence |
| `WORLD_VIEWER_V1_SANDBOX_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | Bounded synthetic-demo plan |
| `tasks/KAIOS-WV-SBX-001.task-envelope.json` | Single-task Cursor execution envelope |

## 7. Implementation Boundary

GitHub Pages can safely serve public snapshots and the read-only interaction shell. It cannot be trusted to authorize ownership changes or protect private credentials. Any future write action requires a separately approved command gateway, authentication design, persistence model, audit trail and Human-approved implementation plan.

Until that gate exists, context-menu actions produce a previewable `LAND_USE_PROPOSAL` intent only.

## 8. Next Gate

The 88/100 `APPROVE_WITH_AMENDMENTS` review was resolved under the World Viewer-specific Level B delegation in `HUMAN-PRIMEFORGE-FULL-AUTOPILOT-001`. Architecture publication and an isolated synthetic sandbox task are authorized. The next operational gate is Codex closeout of the existing Cursor Claim followed by one atomic/manual task assignment.

- `APPROVE_FOR_INDEPENDENT_UI_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW`
- `REQUEST_UI_ARCHITECTURE_REVISION`
- `HOLD_WORLD_VIEWER`
- `REJECT_WORLD_VIEWER_ARCHITECTURE`

No decision in this package authorizes real land, KYC, GPS, ownership mutation, backend write service or production deployment.
