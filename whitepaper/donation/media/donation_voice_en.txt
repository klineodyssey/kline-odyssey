This is not an investment.
This is not a campaign.
And this is not about profit.

This is a place for truth to remain.

In a world where stories are shortened,
meanings are edited,
and reality is buried by noise,
Wukong does not choose sides.

Wukong does not sell fear.
Wukong does only one thing:

To leave words unaltered.
To let truth stay visible.

If you choose to support this work,
you are not donating money.

You are preserving a position,
where truth can still exist.
